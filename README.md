## Project #5: Hangman (Java)
Repo: https://github.com/sanchezbarry/hangman

### Description
A simple hangman app created after learning Java from a Udemy course. The game picks a random word from a list of words from an array, and users guess a letter at each time. The game only takes the 1st character of the user's input, in order to prevent mutiple guesses at once. This also helps to keep track of the wrong guesses accurately.

## Project #1: : Tipsy Bartender
Website: https://sanchezbarry.github.io/sanchezbarry/
Repo: https://github.com/sanchezbarry/sanchezbarry
This website makes use of an API database (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) to recommend drink recipes based on what booze you have lying around!

3 different  methods are called on the website,
1. Search by ingredient (To generate the available cocktails for the selected alcohol)
2. Lookup a random cocktail (To generate a random drink)
3. Lookup full cocktail details by id (To generate a full recpie after the user has chosen his/her drink)

On top of this, the website has a share function to share it on social media, and a favourite drink function, to save the user's favourite drink.

The save function makes use of local storage.

### Tech
The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For CSS, Bootstrap was used.
