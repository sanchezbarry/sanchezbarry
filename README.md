https://sanchezbarry.github.io/sanchezbarry/
This website makes use of an API database (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) to recommend drink recipes based on what booze you have lying around!

3 different  methods are called on the website,
1. Search by ingredient (To generate the available cocktails for the selected alcohol)
2. Lookup a random cocktail (To generate a random drink)
3. Lookup full cocktail details by id (To generate a full recpie after the user has chosen his/her drink)

On top of this, the website has a share function to share it on social media, and a favourite drink function, to save the user's favourite drink.

The save function makes use of local storage.

### Tech
The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For CSS, Bootstrap was used.
