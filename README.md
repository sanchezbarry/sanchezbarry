## Welcome to the Tipsy Bartender!

This website makes use of an API database (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) to recommend drink recipes based on what booze you have lying around!

3 different  methods are called on the website,
1. Search by ingredient (To generate the available cocktails for the selected alcohol)
2. Lookup a random cocktail (To generate a random drink)
3. Lookup full cocktail details by id (To generate a full recpie after the user has chosen his/her drink)

On top of this, the website has a share function to share it on social media, and a favourite drink function, to save the user's favourite drink.

The save function makes use of local storage.

The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For CSS, Bootstrap was used.
